# Iris Dataset Analysis Project

## Description
This project analyzes the Iris dataset to explore different species of Iris flowers based on their sepal and petal dimensions. It aims to provide insights into how these features differ among species, helping in the field of machine learning and data science.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Features
- Data visualization of Iris species using scatter plots.
- Summary statistics for each species.
- Machine learning model implementation for species classification.

## Installation Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/iris-dataset-analysis.git
   cd iris-dataset-analysis
2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn

# Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
    jupyter notebook Iris_Analysis.ipynb

2. Run the cells to perform data analysis and visualize the results.
